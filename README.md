# Project description

api.video's Flutter uploader uploads videos to api.video using delegated upload token or API Key.

It allows you to upload videos in two ways:

- standard upload: to send a whole video file in one go
- progressive upload: to send a video file by chunks, without needing to know the final size of the video file

# Getting started

```bash
flutter pub add video_uploader
 ```
 
This will add the following lines to your package's pubspec.yaml file:

``` yaml

import 'package:video_uploader/video_uploader.dart';
